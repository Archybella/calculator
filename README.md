This project describes the process of creating a basic calculator application with JavaScript and HTML. This is a comprehensive project that involves multiple steps and features. I'll break down the steps for you to help you get started:

Create Basic Functions:

Define functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Test these functions in your browser's console to ensure they work correctly.
HTML Structure:

Create an HTML structure for your calculator using buttons for digits, operators, and special keys like "Equals," "Clear," and "Backspace."
Set up a display area to show the current input and results.
JavaScript Logic:

Create variables to store the first number, operator, and second number.
Implement a function called operate that takes an operator and two numbers as arguments and performs the selected operation.
Implement functions to update the display when number buttons are clicked.
Button Click Events:

Add event listeners to each button to capture user interactions.
Handle button clicks to update the variables based on user input.
Operator Handling:

When an operator button is clicked, store the current number and operator in variables.
When a second number is entered and the "Equals" button is clicked, call the operate function to perform the operation and display the result.
Decimal Handling (Extra Credit):

Implement a decimal point button.
Ensure only one decimal point is allowed in the input.
Backspace and Clear Handling (Extra Credit):

Implement a "Backspace" button to remove the last entered digit.
Implement a "Clear" button to reset the calculator to its initial state.
Keyboard Support (Extra Credit):

Add keyboard event listeners to handle key presses.
Map keys to their corresponding actions (e.g., numbers, operators, "Equals," "Clear," etc.).
Styling (Extra Credit):

Apply CSS styles to make your calculator visually appealing.
Differentiate operator buttons from numeric buttons.
Error Handling (Extra Credit):

Display a snarky error message when dividing by zero.
Prevent invalid inputs that could cause issues.
